Can we reduce the complexity of our setup by putting a few conventions in place?

Because I expect that each account will only have 2-3 groups anyways: `infra-admins`, a group for maintainers, and maybe a read-only group.\r\n\r\nThis does assume that the \"admin\" access for all accounts looks the same, i.e. that we don't limit `docs-rs-staging` to just ECS and RDS, and `dev-desktop-prod` to just `EC2`. Which raises the bigger question on how we want to protect the accounts against mistakes/malice in the first place. `AdministratorAccess` might be a bit broad, and we probably want/need to create budget limits.

things:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is a fairly big change, and it might take a couple of iterations to get it right, so I'd strongly recommend only working on a non-prod namespace at first, while you refine the code (unless you've already done that in a separate AWS account)\r\n\r\nSecondly, it looks here as though you're re-using the existing database username and password, but sticking 'ro-' on the front.\r\nThis means that, if someone wanted the real root user and password, they could just remove the 'ro-' part of the credentials they have, and they would have them.\r\nI know that's not really such a big deal, since anyone who can access the readonly secrets could also access the root secrets, but it does feel a bit icky.\r\nInstead, you could use a fixed string for the username (e.g. \"readonly-db-user\") and a `random_password` resource like this for the password:\r\n```\r\nresource \"random_password\" \"password\" {\r\n  length  = 16\r\n  special = false\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen, you would create a kubernetes secret to store `random_password.password.result`, and use that to access your data.\r\n\r\nYou can see how the rds module does this, here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance/blob/1c2666d26e5c1818b731f757ead413e62987bfcb/main.tf#L29\r\n"]}, {"url":

Suggestion:\r\n\r\nSNS topic name: \"alb_500_errors\" --> \"alb_500_errors_$ClusterName\"\r\nLambda name: \"cw_to_slack\" --> \"cw_to_slack_$ClusterName\"\r\n\r\nThis means we need to pass cluster name to the sub-module, \r\n\r\nI think the input variables need to be more aligned with other sections, though I realise this is hardly documented at all:\r\n\r\n- All input variables for this sub-module should have the same prefix\r\n- The name/identifier of the module, should be the first part (until the first underscore)\r\n- Though this is definitely closely related to Traefik and ALB, it's first and foremost a CloudWatch alarm\r\n- We may want to have other CloudWatch alarms (e.g. for NLBs, or even something completely different), so it's still a good idea to include \"alb\"\r\n- The input variables generically states \"..._alb_...\", but are specifically for a module for http 500 errors only - maybe use \"..._alb_500_...\" \r\n\r\nSuggested new input variables:\r\n\r\ncw_alb_alerts_deploy --> cwalarms_alb_500_deploy\r\ntraefik_alb_slack_hook --> cwalarms_alb_500_slack_hook\r\ntraefik_alb_slack_channel --> cwalarms_alb_500_slack_channel\r\ntraefik_alb_lambda_name  --> none (infer value in module)\r\ntraefik_alb_sns_name --> none (infer value in module)\r\n\r\nThe \"albs\" variable passed to the sub-module is not very descriptive. Suggest change to \"alb_arn_suffixes\".\r\n\r\nThe way the list of alb_arn_suffixes could be greatly simplified, if the outputs from the ALB modules works like the FQDN output.

Not all \"files\" in src are coming from files. Some are computed e.g. the terraform `*.tf.json` files\r\n3. There are cases to consider:\r\n   - a file exists in multiple `src` directories... (decision: which one to choose?)\r\n   - a file from a `src` doesn't exist in `destination` (decision: easy decision just copy over)\r\n   - a file from a `src` is different in `destination` (decision: easy copy over since `src` is source of truth but use should be notified of change)\r\n   - a file in `destination` exists that isn't in any `src` directories (decision: keep? but notify user there is an unwatched file?)\r\n\r\nBasically the multiple src issue and dynamic generation of files is what led me to write those functions.\r\n"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1798", "comments": ["Weird those had execute permissions.

Since 0.3.12 is an older version, there is no need to change that at all. At that point in time, for an upgrade to 0.3.12 we needed to add the `default_images.conda-store` field. We still do, in theory, for any upgrade to 0.3.12. (Although, of course, anyone running `qhub upgrade` with the latest code will actually be upgrading to 0.4.0. However, the way it works is that it can still upgrade from e.g. 0.3.10 to 0.4.0 by going through every intermediate step.)\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, what I really meant was that in `Upgrade_0_4_0` you need to do the opposite of what we did in `Upgrade_0_3_12`. We need to remove the `default_images.conda-store` key from the config.\r\n\r\nIf you look at `Upgrade_0_4_0` you can see we do some similar things there. We remove the `security.users` and `security.groups` fields, for example. We also remove a key called `terraform_modules`.\r\n\r\nSo have a think about how you could just add something similar to remove `default_images.conda-store` if it exists (which it should, but best to check).\r\n\r\nAnd then we also need `qhub deploy` to work of course, so we need to think about how we can not pass in the `default_images.conda-store` field to the Terraform code, and just have it have a non-overridable default for the image within the Terraform code. Where we pass the image variable in now, we just need to ensure the variable is no longer available and we just have a raw string.\r\n", "That will work fine, and I can approve. However, it is just worth noting that you could remove either:\r\n```\r\n        \"conda-store-image\": _split_docker_image_name(\r\n            \"quansight/conda-store-server:v0.3.9\"\r\n        ),\r\n```\r\nfrom `input_vars.py`\r\nOR\r\n```\r\n  default = {\r\n    name = \"quansight/conda-store-server\"\r\n    tag  = \"v0.3.9\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nfrom `conda-store/variables.tf`\r\n\r\nYou don't actually need both! However, it is perfectly acceptable how you have done it because you could argue that you want the separation between the script in input_vars.py and the Terraform module for conda-store. Maybe you think that the Terraform module should be able to be self-contained (and still have a default image) in case whatever calls it doesn't want to pass through the image name, for any reason.\r\n\r\nOf course, right now the two sections of code are tightly-coupled and always located close by in the same relatively-small codebase.\r\n\r\nSo on the other hand, you might not like the way you have essentially duplicated the number of places where you specify the default image name and tag. Imagine if we need to change the conda-store image within the QHub code (e.g. to v.3.10 when it comes out). You might only remember to do it in one place, at which point you might be specifying v0.3.9 in input_vars but v.0.3.10 in variables.tf - in which case you will end up still using v0.3.9 because it overrides the default. Or you might end up with it the other way round: specify v0.3.10 in input_vars but v0.3.9 in variables.tf, in which case you would end up using v0.3.10 after all, for the same reason - that input_vars overrides the default set in variables.tf.\r\n\r\nThe point here is that it would then be difficult to really know which version is in use just by looking at the code. It would be easy to only look at the wrong place and get the wrong answer."]}, {"url": "https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1102", "comments": ["@viniciusdc this looks good to me.

It'd be great if we could also push to DockerHub, but we should ensure we don't interfere with the current platform (e.g. perhaps pushing the `latest` tag can impact e2e tests). As an aside, as you mentioned before the ECR repo is private - is it possible to make it public with Terraform?\r\n- It looks like tagging commits with `1.0.*-release` shouldn't affect the current platform. Are we happy using this versioning system? I presume we'll change the deploy pipeline to watch for commits tagged with `*-release` to trigger deploys.\r\n- Currently we build an image when a new commit is merged into the main branch. Have you thought about where we'll run tests against the main branch before we build an image for it?\r\n- Have you considered how we'll build images for each branch (this is what the current platform does), to enable branch deploys?", "I'm happy for this to go in.
