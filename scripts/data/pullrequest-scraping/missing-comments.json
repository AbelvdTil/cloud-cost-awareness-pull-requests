Can we reduce the complexity of our setup by putting a few conventions in place?

Because I expect that each account will only have 2-3 groups anyways: `infra-admins`, a group for maintainers, and maybe a read-only group.\r\n\r\nThis does assume that the \"admin\" access for all accounts looks the same, i.e. that we don't limit `docs-rs-staging` to just ECS and RDS, and `dev-desktop-prod` to just `EC2`. Which raises the bigger question on how we want to protect the accounts against mistakes/malice in the first place. `AdministratorAccess` might be a bit broad, and we probably want/need to create budget limits.
